# 42-Basecamp
42 School selection process. January 31st to February 19th, 2022

### Hard Skills

    C Programming Language:
    
                Basecamp encompasses a comprehensive range of topics, starting from fundamental 
                concepts such as operators, variables, pointers, memory allocation, libraries, 
                and extending to advanced resources. These are leveraged to tackle challenges 
                and replicate existing standard functions effectively.

    Shell:          
    
               c00 and c01 cover Shell commands, progressing from basic to advanced 
                commands in the command line interface, aimed at improving your proficiency 
                and comfort level with terminal usage.

    Git:
    
                All projects are submitted to a remote Git repository, highlighting 
                the criticality of acquiring Git skills right from the outset.

### Soft Skills

    Self-learning and Colaboration:
    
                 Self-learning is fundamental to 42's peer-to-peer learning methodology, 
                 where traditional teachers are absent. The learning process revolves 
                 around searching, consulting classmates, and each student progressing 
                 at their individual pace while mutually supporting each other with their knowledge.

    Time management and Resiliency:
    
               It is possible and benefic to engage in coding round the clock, yet effective 
               time management is crucial to meeting deadlines and maintaining resilience to 
               prevent burnout during the learning process.
    
    Teamwork: 
    
                On weekends, a 48-hour team project called "Rush" is assigned. In this project, 
                a group of three members, selected randomly by the school's system, collaboratively 
                develops a fully functional application. The primary challenge lies in balancing 
                varying levels of knowledge among team members and establishing a cohesive work 
                methodology that enables everyone to contribute effectively.
